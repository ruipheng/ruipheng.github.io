Under the new welfare system, the law encourages welfare clients to work on their own for a<br />gradual shift away from welfare, and this is not the case in the past. Welfare clients now can develop<br />their talents to make money. In the past, they often cheated to bleed the system for a few extra dollars.<br />Now caseworkers will gladly help their clients find appropriate jobs rather than act like detectives to<br />try to seek out any unreported properties. Today many welfare clients have made a choice to live a life<br />of complete honesty and they tell the truth to caseworkers and declare any extra income they make.<br />In cases like this, caseworkers will feel greatly relieved because they don't need to search for any<br />cheating as in the past.</p><p><br />Unit 5</p><p>Section A<br />Comprehension o f the text<br />I.<br />1.
